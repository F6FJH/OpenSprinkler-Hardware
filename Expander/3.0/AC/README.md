- Version 3.0 uses PCF8575 16-channel IO expander. Due to the weak source current, PNP transistors are used per channel to provide higher source current needed to drive triac.

- Version 3.1 uses PCA9555 16-channel IO expander, which provides higher source current and therefore eliminates the need of PNP transistors.
